[Flamegraphs][0] are awesome if you need to profile your node.js application.
They provide a nice looking visual view of where your application is spending
it's time. Although they're [well][0] [documented][1], no one has ever said a
word on how this thing is really working internally, but everyone is mentioning
"ustack helper" which is working only on SmartOS right now.

Call stack
==========

To understand profiling, one must understand what is call stack. During it's
lifetime every application is using [stack][2], which is a chunk of memory that
could be changed by using `push`, `pop`, `call` and other CPU instructions, or
by accessing it directly.

`push` and `pop` instructions will simply expand/shrink stack storing/loading
data to the top of it. `call` instruction is a little bit more interesting:

_(Quote from
  [Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual][3])_

    ...the processor pushes the value of the EIP register (which contains the
    offset of the instruction following the CALL instruction) on the stack (for
    use later as a return-instruction pointer). The processor then branches to
    the address in the current code segment specified by the target operand.

So in pair with `ret` instruction `call` allows you to jump into some function
and return back to the place where it was called. (Despite it's simplicity, I
still find it amazing.)

That's how calling functions really work internally, but stack can also be used
to store local (on-stack) function's data. This is achieved using stack frames,
lets look how functions do usually look:

_(I'll use [AT&T assembly syntax][4])_

    push ebp ; Save previous frame pointer
    mov  esp, ebp ; Set new frame pointer
    sub  $0x60, esp ; Allocate space on stack

    ; Function's body.
    mov  $0x10, -0x8(%ebp) ; set on-stack variable

    mov  ebp, esp ; Shrink stack to it's initial value
    pop  ebp ; Restore previous frame pointer
    ret  0 ; Return to caller

If represented graphically stack is generally looks like this:

![Callstack](/images/callstack.png)

The main pros of using following structure are:

 * Easiness of contracting stack back to it's initial position
 * Fast and simple access of on-stack variables

Stack trace
===========

Suppose application has thrown exception or crashed with segmentation fault,
to find the cause of the problem one may start by looking at stack trace where
the crash has happened:

    #0  0x00007fff84356d16 in kevent ()
    #1  0x00000001000557b7 in kqueue_poll ()
    #2  0x000000010004c77a in uv__run ()
    #3  0x000000010004c92a in uv_run ()
    #4  0x0000000100015319 in node::Start ()
    #5  0x000000010000dd24 in start ()

Here, on the left, you can see addresses of functions' code. Debugger gets them
by taking current `eip` and `ebp` registers (which stands for current
instruction address and current stack frame address), walking stack frames and
collecting return addresses from it. On the right side, you can see functions'
real names. [gdb][5] automatically loads this information for you by searching
for debugging symbols corresponding to addresses it has collected.

Flamegraph
==========

In order to create flamegraph, one will need to periodically collect
application's stack traces and join them (this's called
[statistical profiling][6]),  making boxes with functions that were called more
often - wider, and putting box on the top of another box only if their functions
appear above each other in the stack trace.

V8's stack frames
=================

When collecting stack traces of C/C++ application, dtrace will use static
debugging information provided by compiler. But when it comes to dynamic
languages, providing such information turns to be more complicated: functions
are compiled lazily, often recompiled with applied optimizations, old code may
be evicted by GC... in other words, application is evolving during it's
execution.

Thankfully, v8 is providing this information, but instead of debugging symbols
it stores it in stack frames. Here is an example of v8's stack frame structure:

![V8 Callstack](/images/v8-callstack.png)

So knowing this structure we can identify frames by checking marker/function
value and getting function names from v8's heap (it's too big topic to cover
here, believe me).

That's exactly a job of ustack helper, it takes frame address and should figure
out and return function's name, or just fail. So everytime you call `jstack()`
function in DTrace probe, ustack helper will be called for every not-identified
frame.

ustack helper example
=====================

_NOTE: some knowledge of D language is required to fully understand code below_

    dtrace:helper:ustack:
    {
      /* frame pointer */
      this->fp = arg1;

      /* Last instruction - result */
      "whoa! you've identified me";
    }

If you'll replace contents of `src/v8ustack.d` in node.js sources, recompile it
(on SmartOS), run `bash benchmark/http-flamegraph.sh`, and open `stacks.src`,
which should contain following stack traces:

    node`_ZN2v88internal7Context14native_contextEv
    node`_ZN4node10StreamWrap15WriteStringImplILNS_13...
    node`_ZN4node10StreamWrap15WriteUtf8StringERKN2v89ArgumentsE+0x9
    whoa! you've identified me
    whoa! you've identified me
    whoa! you've identified me

As you can see, DTrace has identified some C++ functions and for all other
addresses has called our ustack helper.

Lets read some data from v8's stack frame:

    #define FP_MARKER (-2 * 8)
    #define FT_ENTRY (1 << 32)

    /* Init */
    dtrace:helper:ustack:
    {
      this->fp = arg1;
      this->done = 0;
      this->marker = (uint64_t) 0;
    }

    /* Get marker */
    dtrace:helper:ustack:
    {
      this->marker = *(uint64_t*) copyin(this->fp + FP_MARKER,
                                         sizeof(uint64_t));
    }

    /* Match entry marker */
    dtrace:helper:ustack:
    /this->marker == FT_ENTRY/
    {
      this->done = 1;
      "entry";
    }

    /* Match everything else */
    dtrace:helper:ustack:
    /!this->done/
    {
      "everything else";
    }

Run it again, and if you're lucky enough you'll find this in `stacks.src`:

    everything else
    everything else
    entry
    node`_ZN2v88internalL6InvokeEbNS0...

Important things about ustack helper:

* It's running within kernel (though, in it's own context, so it can't crash
  it). The most important consequences of it is that user-land addresses can't
  be accessed directly, but only by using `copyin()` function.
* Usage of control flow statements (if/foreach/while) in DTrace scripts is
  prohibited, since all probes should terminate in a reasonable time. Otherwise
  infinite loop in kernel space will cause your system to halt.


Debugging ustack helper
=======================

During development of 64bit platform support for node.js ustack helper, I found
that it's pretty hard to debug ustack helper. The only method to do this is
insertion of probes which are returning some debugging information, and
observing this information later in stack traces.

Additionally, it's worth noting that failed `copyin()` or any bad memory access
won't produce any informative output, but you'll see raw address in stack trace
(i.e. 0x0000000012345678) rather than your pretty real function's name.

Epilogue
========

You can look at/play with node's [ustack helper][7], big kudos to
[Dave Pacheco][8] for developing it!
